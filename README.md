# RUST---Particle-Swarm-Optimization-ndarray-ndarray_rand-
This GitHub repository provides a high-performance implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm written in Rust. It leverages the ndarray ecosystem for efficient multidimensional array operations and ndarray-rand for high-speed stochastic sampling.
